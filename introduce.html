      <td>3ds Max has a very good performance price ratio. Its powerful functions far exceed its own low price. Ordinary production companies can afford it. In this way, the production cost of works can be greatly reduced</td>
      <td>Before the emergence of client scripting language such as JavaScript, the traditional data submission and verification were transmitted to the server by the client browser through the network. If the amount of data is large, it is an invisible waste of network and server resources. Using JavaScript, you can verify the data on the client.</td>
      <td>With the continuous development of film, market and television technology, film and television program production is becoming more and more market-oriented, and various professional production companies have sprung up. The production of TV programs is more carried out by means of social bidding. The demand for new media production industry is also higher.</td>

      <td>At present, there are many browsers on the Internet, such as Firefox, Internet Explorer, opera, etc., but each browser supports JavaScript to a different extent. When browsing a home page with JavaScript script, due to the slightly different support for JavaScript, the effect will be different, and sometimes it will not even be displayed.</td>
      <td>Diverse talents, high competitiveness and high requirements for technical level.</td>
      <td>In terms of content depth, long video has the advantage that short video can't reach. Long video often needs some thought-provoking content to attract consumer groups. Because of its long time advantage, this thought-provoking is coherent and profound.</td>

      <td>The lighting and lens in the live broadcasting room have a great impact on the appearance of goods, which may mislead consumers. For example, the lens definition is not enough, or the anchor takes the initiative to use filters and special effects, which has an impact on the real experience of beauty and clothing products.</td>
